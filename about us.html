            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p class="text">
                Since 1995, Eagle squad security Group has offered premium security services across Uganda.
                 The firm was founded as a passion project by our Chairman General Caleb Akandwanaho (Rtd.) 
                 and has quickly grown into a multidisciplinary organisation.
                 Our firmâ€™s history is intricately linked to that of a liberated Uganda, enveloped with hope and zeal for
                 rebuilding our country and securing a bright future for our people. We have grown from a handful of employees 
                 to a formidable force of five thousand brave men and women.
                 Our primary objective is to be a service provider of turnkey security solutions. Saracen Uganda offers services 
                 covering a wide range of applications and expertise benchmarked by international industry standards.
                 We are a legally registered provider for Security Services and work closely with the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
                 of Uganda and the Uganda Police Force to achieve shared goals in the security industry.
